## These are my files as I learn to code python from Stanfords Code In Place 

I will be adding , subtracting , and rearranging not only the projects but the code itself.
As I learn more I will try to make cleaner code with lots of comments for people to get a
grasp of my work. 

With that being said this will be a work in progress file , I will comment the final version 
when I do reach it.
